# Big Red Mute Button

### This repo contains all the code made for the big red mute button that is shown [here](). 


With the release of Chrome 80, a new web API was shipped with the browser. This API allows the browser to communicate via serial with other devices, however is behind a flag. This project makes use of that API to communicate with an Arduino Micro that opens a serial port over USB. Both are set to the 6900 baud rate, so that they can communicate with each other. 

This makes use Tampermonkey to inject a script that will allow you to connect to any device over serial, and when a connection is established, the javascript will hijack the mute button (of the DOM) and will read the status of the button, and will send a first command to the connected device. Then, with the MutationObserver API, whenever the button is clicked, it will read again the status of the button, and send over the command to the arduino. 

The arduino accepts (over serial) two string values: a '0' and a '1',when is 0 the light is turned off, and when is '1' the light is turned on. It's the browser that tells if the LED is on or off. When you press the "physical" button, the arduino will detect the press and send it over to the browser (by writing a '0' on the console), and the browser will check the current status of the mute, and toggle it.

# TODO:
- Fritzing & Schematics
- Moving JS code into an extension

# Sugested Upgrades
- Replace the relay with a MOSFET or a H-Bridge. This is a massive upgrade because it saves space and removes the clicking sound of the relay
